# How to use instructions

1. see requirements.txt

2. **getting-files.ipynb** will give you **test_set.pkl** as a dump
  
3. **our_cnn_ourdata.ipynb** is the main file to run, which takes the pickle dump **test_set.pkl** and runs, trains, and tests our CNN

other files are experimental or were used throughout the trial-and-error process
